								Here's one that's been baking since 2016. The Knightmouse character has been around since 2009, a project for my animation degree. He's been a jumping-off point for many small projects, because he is such a blank-slate protagonist. But there-in lies the issue - the characterisation doesn't force me into a box. Knightmouse has no built-in hooks or limitations, the design space is literally "medieval action and adventure". My first attempts at a design really aren't work talking about, before I had much experience with modern table top games. However, recent ideas revolve around bag-building and shared deck-building, where players are actively changing a central deck of events by the choices they make. However, I can't focus the gameplay because I don't have a clear end-game condition in mind. What should the gameplay be pushing the players toward? I can very clearly visualise the early turns, but I cannot pinpoint what the final turn or two of the game will involve.
								<p>So, to clarify this in my mind, this weeks focus will be honing in on the exact player experience I'm seeking, and building a framework around that for the rest of the game to sit in.
